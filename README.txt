Assignment: Web Development "How-to Guide"

Hosted Deliverable: https://proulxp.github.io/CS290-How-To-Guide/index.html

Description: The purpose of this "How-to" guide is to act as a research paper highlighting the knowledge gained from researching a selected API. For my guide, I chose to research the NASA API library. This library is extensive and because of this I chose to focus on the three sub-API’s of the EPIC, ROVER, and NEO API’s. The site linked above acts as the deliverable for this project. The hosted code on GitHub is based on a HTML/CSS template that has been modified to display my hosted content. Any modified files from the original template make the appropriate references. The EPIC.js, ROVER.js, and NEO.js JavaScript files contain the development of the API research and are the working code for the hosted web application portions of the site. These files can be found in the js folder in this repository.
